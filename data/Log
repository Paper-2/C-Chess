    - 12:39:53 The logging system was created.
	- 13:13:34 testing the logging system from the terminal
	- 13:15:14 a bit rudimentary, but it works. This should see some updates in the futures, but now I will start with the actual coding project
	- 13:17:10 I should add a system to count how many hours was spent on a single project
	- 13:18:42 And another system to log commits to the main branch

	- 04:17:24 I will try to fix Visual studio before I continue doing work on the project 
	- 04:31:16 it's fixed now
	- 04:31:46 The problem was that I missed #ifndef FILENAME_H ... part (Amend: This is called a header guard
				they work by preventing the header file being defined multiple times in the same object file)
	- 04:31:56 silly, I know
	- 04:32:35 we love boiler plate don't we folks?	
	- 04:35:26 I'll go to sleep now, but this is kind of huge. I will work more on this
				when I wake up trust

	- 19:05:14 I can now use relative paths

Day 13 -- 2025-05-10
	- 00:34:07 Apparently a filler bit is just that. A filler. it does not do anything, i'll krill myself
	- 00:34:41 this means that I have to deal with handling the transparency myself....
	- 17:26:28 the controller can now move pieces
	- 17:26:51 and a hint circle will now be displayed wherever a piece could move
	- 17:27:33 more work in isValidMove is needed as a piece like a rook can jump over pieces
	- 17:27:51 castling is also needed
	- 17:28:01 after all of this is done
	- 17:28:20 I will work on adding sounds which will be fun!!!!@
	- 17:29:32 earlier, I encountered a bug where the hint circle would be more transparent the farther it is from the left side, why this happens I don't know.
